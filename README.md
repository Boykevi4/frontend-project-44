## Games description:
 * ```brain-games``` - The game just greets the user;
 * ```brain-even``` - You are shown a random number. You must answer "yes" if the number is even, or "no" if it is odd;
 * ```brain-calc``` - The simple calculator game;
 * ```brain-gcd``` - Find greatest common divisor of 2 numbers;
 * ```brain-progression``` - Find missing number in progression;
 * ```brain-prime``` - Define is number prime.

## Games demonstration:
### 1. Brain-even
The player is shown a random number. He needs to answer yes if the number is even, or no if it is odd.
